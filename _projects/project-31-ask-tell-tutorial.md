This tutorial is aimed at experimentalists in wet lab settings, who have data workflows in an ask/tell format. We  use real-world data from voltammetry to demonstrate setting up such a workflow. We cover de inner workings of Ax at a begginer-friendly level. We hope this tutorial will streamline the dry-lab lead-time for wet-lab experimentalists setting up Bayesian optimization workflows in ask/tell or human in the loop formats.
